## 1. Introduction to PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, 
and compliance with SQL standards.

### Features:
- Open-source and community-driven
- ACID-compliant transactions
- Advanced indexing techniques
- JSON and XML support
- Support for procedural languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Perl, etc.)
- Full-text search
- Logical and physical replication
- Partitioning and sharding capabilities

## 2. Installation and Setup
##### install PostgreSQL on windows with zip file #####
1) Download and extract zip file from following url
https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries
2) Set environment variables for PostgreSQL bin and lib in system variables
3) Check PostgreSQL version using command 
~ postgres --version
4) Create "data" folder into "pgsql" and use following command
5) Set new system environment variable for database directory i.e. variable name : PGDATA  variable value : D:\postgresql-16.2-1-windows-x64-binaries\pgsql\data
6) Run following command according to initdb.exe and data folder path
~ D:\postgresql-16.2-1-windows-x64-binaries\pgsql\bin\initdb.exe -U postgres -A password -E utf8 -W -D D:\postgresql-16.2-1-windows-x64-binaries\pgsql\data
7) Set password for superuser 
8) Start PostgreSQL
~ pg_ctl -l logfile start
9) Stop PostgreSQL
~ pg_ctl -l logfile stop
10) Restart PostgreSQL
~ pg_ctl -l logfile restart

##### How to use pgAdmin4 from browser #####
1) Open pgadmin4 
2) Navigate to Open File > Runtime > View Log
	Scroll untill the bottom then you will find the following Application Server URL: http://127.0.0.1:{PORT_NUMBER}/?key={YOUR_KEY}
	http://127.0.0.1:59931/?key=YOUR_KEY 
	Copy this and open in your browser  
    
## 3. PostgreSQL Architecture
- **Postmaster Process**: Manages connections and starts subprocesses.
- **Background Processes**: Handles WAL (Write-Ahead Logging), autovacuum, and background writer.
- **Shared Buffers**: Memory buffer for caching data pages.
- **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**: Ensures durability and crash recovery.
- **Client Applications**: Tools like `psql`, pgAdmin, and third-party clients.

### User Management
```sql
CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
ALTER USER myuser WITH SUPERUSER;
DROP USER myuser;
```

## 6. Indexing
Indexes improve search performance.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
DROP INDEX idx_name;
```

## 7. Joins
### Inner Join
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.id;
```
### Left Join
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.id;
```

## 8. Transactions
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET age = 32 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
COMMIT;
-- or ROLLBACK;
```

## 9. Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS SELECT name, age FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM employee_view;
DROP VIEW employee_view;
```

## 10. Stored Procedures and Functions
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_count() RETURNS INT AS $$
DECLARE 
    count INT;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO count FROM employees;
    RETURN count;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## 11. Backup and Restore
### Backup
```bash
pg_dump mydb > backup.sql
```
### Restore
```bash
psql mydb < backup.sql
```

## 12. Security and Permissions
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE employees TO myuser;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE employees FROM myuser;
```

## 13. Performance Optimization
- Use **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** to analyze query performance.
- Use proper indexing.
- Avoid sequential scans by optimizing queries.
- Use partitioning for large datasets.
- Regularly vacuum and analyze tables.

## 14. Extensions
Enable extensions for additional functionalities.
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
SELECT uuid_generate_v4();
```

## 15. Replication and High Availability
- Streaming Replication
- Logical Replication
- Load Balancing with PgBouncer
- Failover using Patroni or repmgr

## 16. JSON Support
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    details JSONB
);
INSERT INTO products (details) VALUES ('{"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200}');
SELECT details->>'name' FROM products;
```

## 17. Common Errors and Solutions
### Connection Issues
```bash
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
```
**Solution**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and `pg_hba.conf` is correctly configured.

### Role Does Not Exist
```bash
FATAL: role "myuser" does not exist
```
**Solution**: Create the role using `CREATE USER`.

### Why `\list` Displays Databases in Console but Not in pgAdmin4 Query Tool?
In the PostgreSQL console (`psql`), `\list` (or `\l`) lists all databases. However, this does not work in the pgAdmin4 Query Tool because it only supports SQL statements. Instead, use:
```sql
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
```
